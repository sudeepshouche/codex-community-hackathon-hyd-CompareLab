TRIBE v2 is a deep multimodal brain encoding model that predicts fMRI brain responses to naturalistic stimuli (video, audio, text). It combines state-of-the-art feature extractors — [**LLaMA 3.2**](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B) (text), [**V-JEPA2**](https://huggingface.co/facebook/vjepa2-vitg-fpc64-256) (video), and [**Wav2Vec-BERT**](https://huggingface.co/facebook/w2v-bert-2.0) (audio) — into a unified Transformer architecture that maps multimodal representations onto the cortical surface.

## Minimal video-response app

This repo now includes a thin prototype that uses the existing TRIBE v2 inference code as a backend pipeline and exposes a small Next.js App Router frontend in `web/`.

The app is intentionally minimal:

- one video upload
- one Python API process
- one response curve
- one peak-moments list

The score shown in the UI is a response proxy derived from the model output, not human sentiment or preference.

### Local run

Open two terminals from the repo root:

```bash
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
nvm use 22.16.0
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m backend.server
```

If you want to point the frontend at a different backend URL, set `TRIBE_API_URL` before starting Next.js.
The backend defaults to CPU for portability; set `TRIBEV2_DEVICE=cuda` only if your local PyTorch build actually supports CUDA.
On CPU, the first analysis can take a few minutes because the video extractor and model are heavy.

## Quick start

Load a pretrained model from HuggingFace and predict brain responses to a video:

```python
from tribev2 import TribeModel

model = TribeModel.from_pretrained("facebook/tribev2", cache_folder="./cache")

df = model.get_events_dataframe(video_path="path/to/video.mp4")
preds, segments = model.predict(events=df)
print(preds.shape)  # (n_timesteps, n_vertices)
```

Predictions are for the "average" subject (see paper for details) and live on the **fsaverage5** cortical mesh (~20k vertices). You can also pass `text_path` or `audio_path` to `model.get_events_dataframe` — text is automatically converted to speech and transcribed to obtain word-level timings.

For a full walkthrough with brain visualizations, see the [Colab demo notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/tribev2/blob/main/tribe_demo.ipynb).

## Installation

**Basic** (inference only):
```bash
pip install -e .
```

**With brain visualization**:
```bash
pip install -e ".[plotting]"
```

**With training dependencies** (PyTorch Lightning, W&B, etc.):
```bash
pip install -e ".[training]"
```

## Training a model from scratch

### 1. Set environment variables

Configure data/output paths and Slurm partition (or edit `tribev2/grids/defaults.py` directly):

```bash
export DATAPATH="/path/to/studies"
export SAVEPATH="/path/to/output"
export SLURM_PARTITION="your_partition"
```

### 2. Authenticate with HuggingFace

The text encoder requires access to the gated [LLaMA 3.2-3B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B) model:

```bash
huggingface-cli login
```

Create a `read` [access token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) and paste it when prompted.

### 3. Run training

**Local test run:**
```bash
python -m tribev2.grids.test_run
```

**Grid search on Slurm:**
```bash
python -m tribev2.grids.run_cortical
python -m tribev2.grids.run_subcortical
```
